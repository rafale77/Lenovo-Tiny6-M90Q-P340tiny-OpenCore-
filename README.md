## What is different?

- This hack is the smallest fully functional hack I was able to build, including a dGPU for DRM. It is also one of the most powerful CPU you can hack on with the a supported iGPU.
- No kext needed for USB mapping as it only has 14 ports and doesn't exceed the macOS limitation. Only one dsdt patch was needed to enable the M.2 USB port.
- For efficiency, I combined all ACPI patches into a single SSDT. ACPI patching adds all the devices (including cosmetic ones) seen on a real iMac20 but avoids cosmetic renaming.
- Recompiled all the kexts with highest level of Xcode optimization and opencore uses the least possible amount of patches and injections. The entire EFI is <2.8MB.
- By default, Boot Chime-enabled and OC Picker-disabled while hotkeys are enabled to reproduce real mac behavior. I even changed the BIOS logo to Apple so through the entire boot process the hack looks and feels like a real mac.
